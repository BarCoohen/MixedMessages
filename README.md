# MixedMessages


## 📌 Description  
This project is a simple **mixedMessages generator** built using JavaScript.  
Each time you run the program, it generates a **unique Message** by randomly selecting words from three different categories.

## 🛠️ How It Works  
- The script randomly picks words from three different lists:
  1. Names 
  2. Descriptions 
  3. Roles 
- The words are then combined into a **single sentence** and displayed in the console.
